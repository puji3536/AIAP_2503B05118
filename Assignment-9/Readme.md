**Explaination-1**<br>
The first version of the code feels more personal and descriptive logic in a clear, human way. The docstring not only states what the function does but also walks the reader through the process in a natural tone. In contrast, the second version is generated by an AI tool—clean, concise, and very structured, but also a bit generic. It focuses on the facts without the extra context or friendly explanation. Overall, the Manual-written docstring has more personality and clarity, while the AI-generated one is efficient and template-like. This comparison helps us see how AI can produce neat documentation quickly, but human-written descriptions often feel more intuitive and engaging.

In the first version, the comments are manually written, so they feel more intentional and focused. They explain only what truly needs clarification, such as the purpose of the class or the reasoning behind a method. The tone is natural and avoids stating the obvious. In contrast, the second version uses AI-style comments that annotate almost every line, often repeating what the code already makes clear. This makes the commentary more detailed but also more mechanical and sometimes unnecessary. Overall, the manual comments offer context and reasoning, while the AI-generated ones provide thorough but overly literal explanations. This helps us see that AI can generate lots of comments quickly, but thoughtful human-written comments are often clearer and more meaningful.

**Explaination-3**<br>
The first version uses manually written NumPy-style docstrings that feel more natural and slightly conversational. They not only describe what each function does but also add small explanations that help beginners understand the reasoning behind the steps. 
The second version looks more like AI-generated documentation. The structure follows NumPy format very strictly, with short, direct statements under clear sections like *Parameters* and *Returns*. These docstrings are clean and consistent but more template-like, offering less context and fewer human-friendly explanations.
Overall, the manual docstrings are more expressive and easier to relate to, while the AI-generated ones are more formal and standardized. This comparison helps us see how AI can quickly produce well-structured documentation, but human-written docstrings often feel clearer, more intuitive, and more personalized.
